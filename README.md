# Protocol-and-delegate

Two simple examples (Swift 4.1):
  * getting information from second ViewController to previous
  * forwarding data to other view with "prepare for segue"

Theory:
 *Communication patterns - the way how to views can communicate with each other
 *Comunication patterns are - protocols/ delegates and notifications/ observers
 *Delegates and protocols are one-to-one communication pattern
 *Notifications and patterns are one-to-many communication pattern
